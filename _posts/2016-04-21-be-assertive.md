I have a firm belief that people need to be assertive. Without being assertive, humans have a tendency to be trodden on and follow a path that isn't their own.

Being assertive means that one takes control of makes his own path.

In the gym today, there was a woman standing near the water cooler with her body facing the other way. I went to get a drink and suddenly hear a voice, "Ex-*cuse* meâ€½". I turned to look at this old woman who must be about 40 years older than me, and she stares at me and snaps in a perfect British accent, "Manners matter!"

There are many paths this story can take. I can curse off this intelligible woman about how her age doesn't mean she can talk to me like that and how she is a racist bigot. Or I can be trodden on and take this verbal abuse. 

Be assertive.
