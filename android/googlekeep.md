Google Keep is a note taking app made by Google which does pretty much everything you would expect it to and a bit more. 

It can take your regular notes and lists, but it can also let you save pictures or drawings along side that text. You can talk into the app, and it will jot down what you said. It has a built in Optical Character Reader to extract text from the image you took (but you'd be better off with other apps for that). You can sort notes into labels as well.

How it handles notifications is great as well. You can have it notify you at a certain time or even at a particular location. The notifications can be recurring or for a single instance.

It syncs with the Google Environment, so you can view your notes online at keep.google.com. Your reminders will also show up in Google Calendar and Google Now. You can even use Google Now to add to notes such as a shopping list.

Since it is in the Google Environment, you can share notes with others who have a Google account, and they will see it in their Keep.

Using the built-in Android share function, you can add notes. There is an accompanying Google Chrome Extension which can add links as notes as well.

It has a nice widget as well.

It follows material design as well and has a nice looking UI that resembles a cork board full of notes. It does not have a night or AMOLED theme however.
