Google Keep has several features including color coding notes, inserting images, creating lists, geo-fencing, shareable notes, and search by color. Users can set time or location-based reminders for notes. Reminders set through Keep are also accessible by other Google applications such as Google Now. Text from images can be extracted using Optical Character Recognition technology. This, however, works only with the English language. Voice recordings created through Keep are automatically transcribed. Google Keep allows users to convert text notes into checklists.

Google Keep allows users to categorize notes using labels, and notes are searchable based on their color, whether they have a reminder, audio, images, or are a list. On the Android app, swiping a note to the left or right in the notes list archives the note. Archived notes appear in the Archive section. Keep also allows users to create a copy (duplicate) of a note. Users can also choose between the List View or Grid View modes on the web. On Android, users can choose between the single-column view and the multi-column view.

How it handles notifications is great as well. You can have it notify you at a certain time or even at a particular location. The notifications can be recurring or for a single instance.

It syncs with the Google ecosystem, so you can view your notes online at keep.google.com. Your reminders will also show up in Google Calendar and Google Now. You can even use Google Now to add to notes such as a shopping list.

Since it is in the Google ecosystem, you can share notes with others who have a Google account, and they will see it in their Keep.

Using the built-in Android share function, you can add notes. There is an accompanying Google Chrome Extension which can add links as notes as well.

It has a nice widget as well.

It follows material design as well and has a nice looking UI that resembles a cork board full of notes. It does not have a night or AMOLED theme however.
