Google Messenger can definitely replace your default OEM messenger app. It looks beautiful and conforms perfectly to Google's Material Design guidelines. It is not the most customizable text message app, but it has a lot of great features:

* Select or take pictures and videos directly from the app and share easily.

* Easy search

* Ability to block SMS senders

* audio messages, emoji support ðŸ˜ƒ, stickers, location sharing, colored text threads, message archiving
