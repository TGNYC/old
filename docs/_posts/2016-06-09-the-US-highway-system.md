Sometimes when you go on a road trip, have you ever wondered: 
## Where'd all these roads come from?"

  The United States is full of highways, parkways, and turnpikes gridding the country into interstates and county roads we all take for granted.
But how did it all come to be? I went to find out.

  It all starts at the end of WWII, when Europe is in a state of destruction and the powers of Europe have just ratified the Treaty of Versailles.
In April 1921, the Allied Raparations Commission determined that Germany owed 132 **billion** German marks to France and Britain, payable in annual installments of 2.5 billion marks.
The new German republic made its first payment in 1921. However, by the following year the German government faced a finiancial crisis and announced that it could not pay any more reparations.
Inflation had begun at the end of the war in Germany, and the German government mainly paid their salaries by printing more money.
